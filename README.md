# README

This theme for vscode is a custom theme influenced by the [Material theme for vim](https://github.com/hzchirs/vim-material) by github user hzchirs.

This theme has:

- High color contrast, to ease eye strain and improve usability for colorblind developers like myself. 👨‍💻
- A Dark background. Because light themes for code editors are just plain silly. 🤡
- Terminal colors that match your editor colors, so you can `git commit` in style. 💅
- Everything else is a nice, dark flat color, to let the menus fade into the background while you get to work on whatever excites you. 🔨

To install this vscode theme, run `git pull https://github.com/Matthew-Lewin/vim-material-vscode.git` from your vscode extensions folder. For Windows users this is likely %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions. For Mac or Linux users, this is probably \$HOME/.vscode/extensions.

If you like this theme, please give it a star 🌟. If you find any issues with my them or think of any improvements for it, go ahead and open a pull request. I would love to see them!
